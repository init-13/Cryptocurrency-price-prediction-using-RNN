# PROJECT---Prediction-of-Cryptocurrency-Price-Using-RNN
This is the final Year project using Machine Learning and Neural Networks to predict cryptocurrency prices.

## Tech Stack Used:

**Python (sckit-learn,numpy,pandas,keras,tenserflow)** -> For Data Scrapping, cleaning, wrangling and training neural network(RNN).

**Web Development(HTML,CSS,JS,React)** -> For deploying interactive website to illustrate and visualize the results.

**Databases(MongoDB)** -> To store and retrieve data containing prices of various CryptoCurrencies.

## About RNN-LSTM:

RNN is a recurrent Neural Network. LSTM is used in training log sequential models, to avoid gradient exploding.
